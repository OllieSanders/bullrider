Use Purpose (2019)
I had bought 10 GPU's to farm ETH and I was using my schools electricity to run the rig. 
I wanted to make an automated trading strategy to try and increase the value of my portfolio.
I was studying statistics at the time commonly using std measures so I used bollinger bands as one of my indicators.

Strategy Outline:
Indicators: Bollinger Bands and RSI
Buy Strategy: Buy when the price is near the lower trendline (min_line), RSI is between 30 and 50, and Bollinger Bands indicate consolidation.
Sell Strategy: Sell when the price is near the upper Bollinger Band and above the resistance trendline (max_line), with an overbought RSI above 70.

I remember backtesting this and running it on historical date of ethereum for a month. 
One week it profited, and 3 weeks it suffered losses. Over the month the portfolio decreased in value by 4%.

I shall run this back on more recent data at some point.

Evaluation:
It was not succesful.

Sidenote:
I'd like to see how it performs on the forex market.
